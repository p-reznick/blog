# About Me

My name is Peter Reznick, and I am a software engineer working at ASAPP in New York City.  I grew up in Washington, DC and graduated from Williams College in 2012.

I am the co-creator of [CorvoStore](https://corvostore.github.io/), an in-memory key-value store modeled on Redis, and the creator of [TrumpKu](http://www.trumpku.net/), a website that generates semi-random haikus.
