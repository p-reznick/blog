# About Me

My name is Peter Reznick, and I am a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY.  I grew up in Washington, DC and graduated from Williams College in 2012.

I am the co-creator of [CorvoStore](https://corvostore.github.io/), an in-memory key-value store modeled on Redis, and the creator of [TrumpKu](http://www.trumpku.net/), a website that generates semi-random haikus.

I am currently in search of full-time opportunities!  Please find my [resume here](../../preznick_resume_dec-2017.pdf), and feel free to reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/p-reznick), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-reznick-ab84a041/), or email.
